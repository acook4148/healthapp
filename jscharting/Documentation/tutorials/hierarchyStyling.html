<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	Customization and control over org relationship paths and Gantt dependencies is provided through
	hierarchy paths, similar to breadcrumbs. These paths are used to customize the connector lines and
	point annotations between points in the hierarchy. For example, you can highlight the path from
	the current hovered point to the top point in the hierarchy or change the styling of the path and
	points when clicking a given point.
</p>

<h2>Style Connector Lines</h2>

<p>
	You can define styling of connector lines for each point individually, and each parent (for points
	with multiple parents).
</p>

<p>
	All connector lines for points in a series can be styled with
	<a href="Types.pointConnector">Series.defaultPoint.connectorLine</a> properties.
	<a href="Types.point.connectorLine">Point.connectorLine</a> allows setting parent connector line
	styling per point, including connectorLine_radius to control the corner rounding. Line styling can
	also be set for individual parent connectors when multiple parents are defined as detailed in the
	following Specifying Parent Points section.
</p>

<h3>Specifying Parent Points</h3>

<p>Parent points are specified by point ID.</p>

<p>Within the context of point object such as:</p>
<span class="codeText">
	var chartOptions = { series:[{ points:[{ id:'id', name:'Node id', },{ id:'id2', name:'Node id2',
	},{ id:'id3', name:'Node id3', },{ id:'id4', name:'Node id4', parent: 'id' }] }] };
</span>

<p>
	The simple way to specify parents for point id4 above through the
	<a href="Types.point.parent">point.parent property</a> is with:
</p>

<span class="example">parent: 'id', or 'id,id2'</span>

<p>You can also define the point connector with ID and line style through the parent property.</p>

<span class="example"
	>parent: {id:'id', line: {color: 'blue'}} or {id: 'id,id2', line: {color: 'blue'}}</span
>

<p>
	Additionally, you can specify an array of point connectors. This example defines 3 parent
	connectors, one with a blue line and two with a green line style.
</p>

<span class="codeText">
	var chartOptions = { series:[{ points:[{ id:'id', name:'Node id', },{ id:'id2', name:'Node id2',
	},{ id:'id3', name:'Node id4', parent: [{id:'id', line:{color:'blue'}}, {id:'id2,id3',
	line:{color:'green'}}] }] }] };
</span>

<h2>Highlight a connector path</h2>

<p>
	To highlight a path between two points or from a point all the way up or down the hierarchy, use
	the <a href="iObject.Chart.connectors()">chart.connectors()</a> function.
</p>

<span class="example">chart.connectors(pathSelector [, style] [, updateOptions])</span>

<h3>Path Selectors</h3>

<p>The syntax for path selectors is</p>
<span class="example">['pointID', (PointID2 or Direction)]</span>

<p>The direction can be one of the following keywords: up, down, (both or all)</p>
<p>This example makes all connector lines from pointID to the top of the hierarchy red:</p>

<span class="codeText">chart.connectors(['pointID', 'up'], { color:'red' });</span>

<p>More examples of path selectors:</p>
<span class="codeText">
	// All branches from pointID down the hierarchy.
['pointID', 'down'],
	// All branches from pointID up and down the hierarchy.
['pointID', 'both'],
	// All branches between pointA and pointB
['pointA', 'pointB'],
	// A specific branch of points.
['pointA', 'pointB', 'pointC'],
	// Multiple branches and selectors.
[['pointA', 'pointC'], ['pointC', 'up']]
</span>


<p>
	This function returns an array of paths where each path is an array of point IDs that are connected.
	If there are multiple paths in your selection, they will all be returned in the array.
</p>

<p>
	The following are some examples using the chart.connector() function. All these examples return
	arrays of paths.
</p>

<span class="codeText">
	/* Style the specified connector lines red.*/
	chart.connectors(['pointID','up'], {color:'red'});

	/* Do nothing except return the paths involved.*/
	chart.connectors(['pointID', 'up'], {});

	/* Reset the specified connector styles to their original state.*/
	chart.connectors(['pointID', 'up']);

	/* Reset all connector lines to their original state.*/
	chart.connectors();
</span>

<p>
	Individual paths (arrays of points) can be used as path selectors to style individual paths with
	the <a href="iObject.Chart.connectors()">Chart.connectors()</a> function as well.
</p>

<p>
	When connectors are styled this way, multiple calls to the
	<a href="iObject.Chart.connectors()">Chart.connectors()</a> function apply the styling updates to
	the prior styles. If you wish to reset styles to the original styling, all styles set in this
	manner can be reset by calling <a href="iObject.Chart.connectors()">Chart.connectors()</a> without
	any arguments.To style a new path only, call
	<a href="iObject.Chart.connectors()">Chart.connectors()</a> without any arguments first to reset
	all styles, then call it again with a path and style to apply it only to the specific path.
</p>

<p>
	When using the <a href="iObject.Chart.connectors()">Chart.connectors()</a> function to get a list
	of paths from a pathSelector and to avoid resetting other styles you have applied, use an empty
	object for line styling. For example:
</p>

<span class="codeText">
	var paths = chart.connectors(['pointID', 'up'], { })
</span>
<p>Without this empty object, the selected paths are reset to their original states.</p>



<h2>Highlight points along the path</h2>

<p>
	To style the points along these paths, you can use the same path selector with the
	Chart.series().points() function to select them.

	<span class="codeText">chart.series().points([pointID,'up']); </span>
</p>

<p><span class="docsNote">
Point collections based on path selectors like the above will return a collection of points sorted
	in the order they were added to the chart. This way they can be removed from the hierarchical
	chart individually starting with the last to first.
</span></p>

<p>
	It is then recommended that you use the point selected or muted states to style these points
	rather than any specific styling options such as color properties, because the selected and muted
	states apply very efficiently and can be used with point hover events maintaining the highest
	performance. For example, to highlight paths up the tree when hovering points, use:
</p>

<span class="codeText">chart.series().points([pointID, 'up']).options({selected: true});</span>

<p>
	In the case of Gantt charts, these paths can traverse multiple series and will still work without
	issues.
</p>

<h4>Important Notes</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Use point states to modify point styling with mouse hover events to optimize performance.</li>
	<li>
		When using series.pointSelection=false to apply a style manually, set
		point_state_selected_enabled:true to ensure the style is created internally.
	</li>
	<li>
		When using the mute state for styling, make sure to have a point mouseOut event handler that
		returns false to prevent automatic mute state changes.
	</li>
	<li>
		Styling lines with chart.connectors() supports animation when you specify updateOptions (3rd
		argument), but not when resetting styles.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Manual Tree Traversal</h2>

<p>
	Point objects have <a href="iObject.Point.getParents()">Point.getParents()</a> and
	<a href="iObject.Point.getChildren()">Point.getChildren()</a> functions that return collections of
	points. This lets you traverse the hierarchy programmatically to manually analyze the tree data if necessary.
</p>
