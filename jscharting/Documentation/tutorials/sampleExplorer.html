<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The sample explorer is an advanced system that gives an unprecedented ability to find samples related to a requirement or
task. A user who is not familiar with the chart API will be able to find a sample that demonstrates what they are looking
for much faster than ever before.
</p><p> People think of chart features with different terminology and often find it difficult to locate samples related to tasks
they need to accomplish. The tree in SampleExplorer is built on extensive relational metadata which allows several
paths to find the same samples.
